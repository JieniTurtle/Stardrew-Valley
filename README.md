# Project Description
  Design a farm life simulation game where players will manage their own farm, grow crops, raise animals, interact with the town's residents, participate in festivals, and explore the surrounding natural environment.
  
  The play should be rich in seasonal changes, community interactions, and personal development.

# Base Features
## Farm Management:
  
  Players can farm, plant, and harvest a variety of crops, with the ripening time of the crops varying according to the species and season.
  
  Farming includes, but is not limited to, animals such as cattle, chickens, and sheep.
  
  Farm operations include watering, fertilizing, and managing the threat of drought and disease, which can lead to crop death if not treated in a timely manner.
  
  Manage farm resources such as water, seeds, and fertilizer storage.
	
## Community Interaction:
  
  Build relationships with the town's residents, including friendships and romantic relationships.
  Participate in regular community events and festivals.
  Gain prestige and reap rewards by accepting and completing missions from your residents, including collecting specific items, helping to repair buildings, and more.
	
## Explore & Adventure:

  Explore the area around the farm, including forests, mountains, and mysterious caves.
  Dig minerals, fish and collect rare items.
	
## Lengths and Skills:

  A variety of skill trees, including farming, mining, fishing, and cooking.
  As you level up your skills, unlock new crop types, tool upgrades, and cooking recipes.

# Bonus Features
## Market Economy System:
  
  Implement a dynamic market price system that affects the selling price of crops and products.
	
## Weather System:
  
  Complex weather patterns affect crop growth and animal behavior, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and seasonal variations. And we can see sunrise and sunset.

## Mini Games:

  Play Gobang with NPCs, and NPCs' decisions are generated by the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

## Physics Engine:

  The most realistic physics engine that enables main character to squeeze and collide NPCs.

## Expansive Map and Layer Occlusion:

  A map consisting of five minimaps unpacked from the origin game, providing ample space for the player to explore. As a by-product, we have correct layer occlusion relationships among characters and more than six map layers.
